# üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Skin Disease Detector & Health Chatbot

An intelligent healthcare application designed to make **preventative care** more **digitally accessible** through an AI-based skin disease detection system and an interactive medical chatbot‚Äîall within a single web interface.

---

## Overview

This web-based platform integrates two core components:

### ü©∫ Skin Disease Detection

Utilizes a fine-tuned Vision Transformer model to analyze skin images and assess the presence of potential dermatological conditions. With an intuitive interface, users can upload a clear skin image and receive immediate, AI-driven feedback on skin health.

### üí¨ Health Chatbot

Powered by the LLaMA-3 large language model through the Together API, the chatbot facilitates medical conversations by:

* Responding promptly to greetings.
* Gathering symptom-related information.
* Suggesting potential conditions.
* Asking follow-up questions to refine predictions.

This solution provides efficient, accessible, and intelligent healthcare assistance, especially valuable for users in remote or underserved areas.

---

## Usability

* Upload a skin image ‚Üí Receive AI-based health insights.
* Type your symptoms ‚Üí Engage with a dynamic and concise medical assistant.
* Mobile-friendly, responsive, and designed for ease of use.
* The chatbot operates independently‚Äîeven if the skin model file is unavailable.

## Model: `inov2-base-finetuned-SkinDisease`

A fine-tuned version of `facebook/dinov2-base`, this model was trained on a custom skin disease dataset to classify images as either **Healthy** or **Possibly Diseased**.

**Performance:**

* Loss: 0.1321
* Accuracy: 95.57%

**Architecture Summary:**
The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model pre-trained in a self-supervised manner. It processes images as sequences of patches with position embeddings and a `[CLS]` token used for classification. A linear classification head was added for this task. This architecture enables strong image understanding, ideal for skin disease classification.

## Setup Instructions

**Requirements:**

Install required packages using:

```
pip install streamlit torch Pillow numpy together
```

**Project Setup:**

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>
```

2. Place the model file (`m1.pth`) in the project root directory.

3. Set your Together API key in the script:

```python
client = Together(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

4. Run the app:

```
streamlit run your_script.py
```

Note: The chatbot will still work even if the model is not found, ensuring accessibility and usability of the app.
